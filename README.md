1. Image Upload: You can easily upload your image in a few clicks. We support a wide range of image formats (JPG, JPEG, etc.)
2. Search by Color or Texture: MIRROR offers you the flexibility to choose between two powerful search options:
-Search by Color: Discover images that share similar color palettes with your uploaded image. 
-Search by Texture: Find images with textures and patterns that match the one you've uploaded. 
3. Results Sorting: Our advanced algorithm quantitatively ranks the search results from the most to least visually similar. You can quickly find images that closely resemble your query.
